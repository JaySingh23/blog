title: sandman is the top trending Python repo on GitHub

I don't often toot my own horn, but I'm quite astonished to report that
[sandman](http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/sandman) is **[the #1 trending Python repo today on GitHub](https://github.com/trending?l=python)**. It's also in the [top ten](https://github.com/trending) for *all* trending repos today.

...and I'm pretty happy about that.
