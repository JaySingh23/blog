# Meet Bull: Sell Digital Products for Free

# "Bull always charges"

As promised everywhere, the first cut of my digital goods payment solution, "Bull" ("Bull always charges") is now up at
[https://github.com/jeffknupp/bull](https://github.com/jeffknupp/bull). It's
still *very* rough and there's a lot I need to make it more user-friendly, but
you could use it **right now** to sell your digital goods (I do).

As you'd expect, I'll be updating the repository frequently over the next few
days. Also, if anyone wants to come up with a "Bull" mascot/logo, I'd be
extremely indebted to you.

As I said in my previous post, sharing useful tools is important, and this is me
practicing what I preach. Hopefully, others will find Bull useful as a way to
free themselves from the existing digital goods payment solutions.
