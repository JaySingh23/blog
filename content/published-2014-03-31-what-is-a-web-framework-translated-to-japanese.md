# 'What is a Web Framework' Translated to Japanese

User `kazu` graciously offered to translate my article, [What is a Web Framework](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/) into Japanese. 
Here's the link to the Japanese version: [http://rdepf.hatenablog.jp/entry/2014/03/31/150142](http://rdepf.hatenablog.jp/entry/2014/03/31/150142).
A big thanks to `kazu` for making the article more accessible to Japanese
readers!
