title: 'Writing Idiomatic Python' Will Become A Series Of Instructional Videos!

The [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1219760486/a-writing-idiomatic-python-video-series-watch-and) to turn [Writing Idiomatic Python](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook) just passed its goal! I'm amazed and humbled that it did so in 7 days. Hopefully, the backers keep coming as $10,000 means the videos are free for everyone, forever!

Thanks for all your help so far!
