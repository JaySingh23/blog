# Need a Project Idea? Scratch Your Own Itch

I'm often contacted by readers who are proficient in Python and would like to
create an open source project/start-up but can't think of a good project. Picking
an idea, indeed, just *getting an idea*, seems like a luck-of-the-draw type
deal. Some people just happen to get great ideas, and the rest of us don't.

**That's garbage.**

Almost all projects/companies exist because someone noticed that others (or,
more likely, they themselves) had a need that wasn't being fulfilled. After all,
if no one needs the product (or think they need it), no one buys it. So
how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be the basis
for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people what problems they have
that you might be able to help solve, or (for introverts like me) **examine what processes or services feel needlessly difficult in your own life**.

Thinking about it now, *all* of my successful projects were successful because I
recognized a need not being met. [Writing Idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/) began
as a humble blog post listing Python idioms. I was frustrated with the code (at
a previous job) that was being produced and wanted to find a list of code
constructs that were considered "Pythonic". Not finding many, I decided to start
a list of my own. The response was so positive that a neon sign saying "Write Me!" 
might as well have appeared, pointing to the book.

I had stumbled on to a need previously unfulfilled in the Python community: a
repository of Python idioms, along with explanations of their use. But it was
originally *my* problem (not being happy with code being written at work) that I
was solving. What eventually became my most successful project to date grew
organically out of solving my own problem.

[Sandman](http://www.sandman.io) and [Bull](http://www.github.com/jeffknupp/bull)
are two more examples of successful projects borne of necessity. Sandman sprung
up when I needed to write a RESTful API against an existing database and didn't
feel like writing all the boilerplate ORM code. Bull exists due to my
frustration with the various services that exist to help sell digital goods. I
took two hours one Friday night and wrote my own, with all of the features I
needed. It's now basically at feature-parity with Gumroad (but free and open
source, of course).

Neither Sandman nor Bull are solving huge, scary problems. In fact, some would
argue that they are almost *too* simple, and in both cases something like them must
already exist. In reality, no one had taken the time to solve those particular 
problems for themselves and open source it. Neither is an earth-shattering idea.
Both address a *real need* that *many* people have.

Solve your own problems first. *Everyone* has interactions with technology that
frustrate them. *Those* are the ideas that are begging to become successful
projects or businesses.
