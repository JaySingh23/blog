Recently, I had an email conversation with a reader of the blog/[book](http://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/).
Apparently, he thought I would be too busy to read (much less respond to) his
email, so he thought, "what the heck, I'll include links to my projects for
him to check out. Can't hurt." Not only did I read and respond to the email, I
checked out the projects as well. *They were awesome.*

The author was hesitant to release them , among other reasons, out of fear the
reception would be negative. It made me wonder if other readers of the blog had open 
source Python projects just waiting to be discovered as well. 

**It's time to find out.**

If you have a project that meets the requirements below, *let me know!* In my
next post, I'll review not only the app, but the *code* as well. I *like* cool
projects, but I *love* great code. Email me the project's URL and be sure to include
a link to the source. If your project is chosen to be featured on the site, I'll 
email you to get your permission to do so. You'll be able to read the review 
before it goes live, so don't worry about getting a "bad" review and having no control over it.

Here are the requirements for project submission:

1. The project is open source - that is, the code is freely available for anyone
to look at, even if the project or license is closed or restrictive.
1. The main implementation language of the project is Python.
1. The project is already live somewhere. No works-in-progress.

If you've got a project that meets those requirements and want more people to
know about it, email me at [jeff@jeffknupp.com](mailto:jeff@jeffknupp.com).
Include a short description of the projects, the link to the source, and the
link to the live site. In the next week or two, I'll review a half-dozen or so
projects (remember, both site and *code*) on this site.

If you're wondering why I'm doing this, it's because I remember how difficult it
was to get any exposure when I first started blogging. Ultimately, I learned,
the quality of the content is what decides if a blog post is shared, not
gimmicks and SEO. So I want the chance to give quality Python projects the
exposure they deserve.
