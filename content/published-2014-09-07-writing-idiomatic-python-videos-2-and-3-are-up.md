# Writing Idiomatic Python: Videos 2 And 3 Are Up!

After a bit of a dry spell on the Kickstarter video front, the second
and third videos of the ten video series are up on YouTube. Saturday saw the release of 
[Writing Idiomatic Python Video Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wym71aDDMyo), in which 
a simple HTTP proxy is refactored according to the principles found in [Writing Idiomatic Python](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/). On Sunday, [Writing Idiomatic Python Video Three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A_udRSen2w) (which
continues the refactoring begun in the second video) was posted.

Together, these two videos contain over *two hours* of content. I also made sure
that the screen resolution/font size issues that a number of people had with the
first video were handled properly. In addition, both videos have their own
GitHub repos (links are on the respective YouTube pages) containing the original
and final versions of the code. A number of people asked about this for video
one as it's useful to compare the old and new versions directly.

Given this surge of momentum, video four shouldn't be far off. The subject of 
the video has already been chosen, and it's something I'm excited about and I
think you'll all enjoy: starting a program from scratch. There are a *huge*
number of things to think about when starting from scratch as opposed to
refactoring existing code. I have a feeling a lot of people will find video four
useful.

Just a reminder, as a result of the amount raised in the Kickstarter campaign,
*all* of the ten videos are freely viewable at any time, distributed under the
Creative Commons license. So feel free to share, embed, remix, or do whatever
else people do with free videos.
