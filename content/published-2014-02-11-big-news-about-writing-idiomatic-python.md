# Big News About Writing Idiomatic Python

## The Beginning of the End

I began writing [Writing Idiomatic Python](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook)
in October of 2012 on somewhat of a whim. I had gotten positive feedback about a
[blog post](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/10/04/writing-idiomatic-python/) by the same name
and a number of people told me it would make a good book. This kicked off an
amazing, multi-year journey that continues to this day. At times it seemed as
though the book would never see the light of day. But thanks to the support of
friends, family, and all of you, I was able complete enough of the book to be
comfortable selling it as a beta version. Today, I think, is the beginning 
of the last leg of the journey.

**I'm happy to announce that the final version of *Writing Idiomatic Python* will be published by [No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com).**

## What Happens Now?

What does this mean? First, No Starch Press will be creating the definitive physical version of the book. 
When the editing process is completed, the version they produce will be
considered the final revision of the book. What's more, it means it will likely
be *a lot* easier to get a physical copy of the book as (hopefully) it will be
in bookstores nationwide.

One thing that won't change: I'll still be selling my book from
[jeffknupp.com](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook).
**I'll also continue to give my book away for free to those who can't afford it.**
My right to do so is stipulated in my contract, and I thank No Starch Press for
agreeing to this. If you want a digital version of the book, you can either buy
it through the site or from various online retailers (Amazon, Google Play Books, iBooks, etc),
sold by No Starch. 

### Testimonials

Lastly, in preparation for the marketing campaign that will accompany the book's
launch, **I'm asking for testimonials about the book.** If you've read it and
have something to say about it, *please [email me](mailto:jeff@jeffknupp.com) with a few sentences containing your thoughts on the book and whether others should read it*. The book has sold as well as it has thanks to
word of mouth. I'm again relying on your support by asking for testimonials.

### Review Copies

Also, *if you'd like a free review copy of the book*, please [let me know](mailto:jeff@jeffknupp.com). Review copies
are ideally followed up by a review, either on your site, on Amazon, or
elsewhere. Please include where your review would appear in your email.

## Isn't the Book *Already* Published?

Yes, in a manner of speaking. It is self-published, meaning that I used a
number of services to get the book on the virtual shelves of Amazon, Google
Play, and others. In addition, I previously made a physical copy available via CreateSpace
(Amazon's self-publishing service for books). That version will be shelved (pun
intended) and No Starch Press's physical version will become the canonical
one.

## Thanks, Again

I'm constantly humbled by the support I receive via email, Twitter, and other
blogs. While getting the book properly published is personally validating, I'm fully 
aware that none of this would have been possible without all of you. *You* got
the book written, and *you* made it popular. You've now helped to get it
published, and for that I'm eternally grateful.
