title: Writing Idiomatic Python Video Four Is Out!

After an unplanned two-year hiatus, the [fourth video in the Writing Idiomatic Python Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZRQ_-jBMLg) is out! This was long overdue, and for that I sincerely apologize. All I can do now is continue to produce the rest at a steady clip and get them out as quickly as possible. I hope you find the video useful! Part 5 will be out soon...
