The [fifth video in the Writing Idiomatic Python Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P4Exogr4FI) is out! Like video four, this was long overdue, and for that I sincerely apologize. Part 5 continues exactly where part four left off and finishes our simple ticketing system using Flask and raw SQL. I hope you find the video useful! Part 6 will be out soon...
