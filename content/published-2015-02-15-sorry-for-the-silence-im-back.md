# Sorry for the Silence. I'm Back!

## I'm Sorry/I'm Back

My second daughter was born on October 27th. I'll be honest: I haven't read email sent to [jeff@jeffknupp.com](mailto://jeff@jeffknupp.com) in almost
three months. In fact, I haven't done anything besides my day job, sleeping, and spending time with my girls for the past three months. Throw in a medical condition (that has been resolved) and you can see why the past few months have been difficult for me. I know that I'm making excuses, but I wanted to add some context about my silence.

Thanks to my incredible wife and daughters, I now have the chance to be active
online once again. For those of you who emailed me and didn't receive a
response, I'm terribly sorry. I promise I will get to every single one in the
weeks ahead. If you asked for a free copy of the book, you'll get one. It's
going to take me a bit of time to catch up with everything, but it will get
done.

For those who supported my Kickstarter campaign, I'll be making more videos
soon. My goal is to get the next one out in the next two weeks. I sincerely
apologize for what must seem like a case of promising something and not
following through. I *will* finish all 10 videos. They will all be free.

So, again, if you've been trying to contact me or have been waiting on me for
something, I'll do my best to build back up the trust you had in me, and I'll
complete all of the various tasks I left half-finished.

My daughters and wife will always take precedence over my online persona, but
I'm now in the position that I can devote more time as my alter-ego.

**tl;dr: I'm Sorry/I'm Back!**
