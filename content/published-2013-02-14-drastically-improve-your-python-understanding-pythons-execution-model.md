# Drastically Improve Your Python: Understanding Python's Execution Model

Those new to Python are often surprised by the behavior of their own code. They
expect *A* but, seemingly for no reason, *B* happens instead.
The root cause of many of these "surprises" is confusion about the Python
execution model. It's the sort of thing that, if it's explained to you once, a number of
Python concepts that seemed hazy before become crystal clear. It's also really
difficult to just "figure out" on your own, as it requires a fundamental shift
in thinking about core language concepts like variables, objects, and functions.

In this post, I'll help you understand what's happening behind the scenes when
you do common things like creating a variable or calling a function. As a
result, you'll write cleaner, more comprehensible code. You'll also become a
better (and faster) code reader. All that's necessary is to forget everything
you know about programming...

###"Everything is an object?"

When most people first hear that in Python, "everything is an object", it triggers 
flashbacks to languages like Java where everything the *user* writes is encapsulated 
in an object. Others assume this means that in the implementation of the Python 
interpreter, everything is implemented as objects. The first interpretation is 
wrong; the second is true but not particularly interesting (for our purposes). 
What the phrase actually refers to is the fact that all "things", be they values, 
classes, functions, object instances (obviously), and almost every other language 
construct is conceptually an object. 

What does it mean for everything to be an object? It means all of the "things" 
mentioned above have all the properties we usually associate with 
objects (in the object oriented sense); types have member functions, functions 
have attributes, modules can be passed as arguments, etc. And it has important 
implications with regards to how assignment in Python works.

A feature of the Python interpreter that often confuses beginners is what happens 
when `print()` is called on a "variable" assigned to a user-defined object (I'll 
explain the quotes in a second).  With built-in types, a proper value is usually 
printed, like when calling `print()` on `strings` and `ints`. For simple, 
user-defined classes, though, the interpreter spits out some odd looking string 
like:

    #!py
    >>> class Foo(): pass
    >>> foo = Foo()
    >>> print(foo)
    <__main__.Foo object at 0xd3adb33f>

`print()` is supposed to print the value of a "variable", right? So why is it 
printing that garbage?

To answer that, we need to understand what `foo` actually represents in Python. 
Most other languages would call it a variable. Indeed, many Python articles 
would refer to `foo` as a variable, but really only as a shorthand notation.

In languages like C, `foo` represents storage for "stuff". If we wrote

    #!c
    int foo = 42;

it would be correct to say that the integer variable `foo` contained the 
value `42`. That is, *variables are a sort of container for values*.

###And now for something completely different...

In Python, this isn't the case. When we say:

    #!py
    >>> foo = Foo()

it would be wrong to say that `foo` "contained" a `Foo` object. 
Rather, `foo` *is a `name` with a `binding` to the `object` created by* `Foo()`. 
The portion of the right hand side of the equals sign creates an object. 
Assigning `foo` to that object merely says "I want to be able to refer 
to this object as `foo`." **Instead of variables (in the classic 
sense), Python has `names` and `bindings`**.

So when we printed `foo` earlier, what the interpreter was showing us was the
address in memory where the object that `foo` is bound to is stored. This isn't as 
useless as it sounds. If you're in the interpreter and want to see if two 
names are bound to the same object, you can do a quick-and-dirty check by 
printing them and comparing the addresses. If they match, they're bound to the 
same object; if not, their bound to different objects. Of course, the idiomatic 
way to check if two names are bound to the same object is to use `is` 

If we continued our example and wrote

    #!py
    >>> baz = foo

we should read this as "Bind the name `baz` to the same object `foo` is bound 
to (whatever that may be)." It should be clear, then why the following happens

    #!py
     >>> baz.some_attribute
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'some_attribute'
    >>> foo.some_attribute = 'set from foo'
    >>> baz.some_attribute
    'set from foo'
    
Changing the object in some way using `foo` will also be reflected in `baz`: they 
are both bound to the same underlying object. 

###What's in a name...

`names` in Python are not unlike names 
in the real world. If my wife calls me "Jeff", my dad calls me "Jeffrey", and my 
boss calls me "Idiot", it doesn't fundamentally change *me*. If my boss decides 
to call me "Captain Programming," great, but it still hasn't changed anything 
about me. It does mean, however, that if my wife kills "Jeff" (and who could 
blame her), "Captain Programming" is also dead. Likewise, in Python binding a 
name to an object doesn't change it. Changing some property of the object, 
however, will be reflected in all other names bound to that object.

###Everything really *is* an object. I swear.

Here, a questions arises: How do we know that the thing on the right hand side of 
the equals sign will always be an object we can bind a name to? What about

    #!py
    >>> foo = 10

or

    #!py
    >>> foo = "Hello World!"

Now is when "everything is an object" pays off. Anything you can (legally) place 
on the right hand side of the equals sign is (or creates) an object in Python. 
Both `10` and `Hello World` are objects. Don't believe me? Check for yourself

    #!py
    >>> foo = 10
    >>> print(foo.__add__)
    <method-wrapper '__add__' of int object at 0x8502c0>

If `10` was actually just the number '10', it probably wouldn't have
an `__add__` attribute (or any attributes at all).

In fact, we can see all the attributes `10` has using the `dir()` function:

    #!py
    >>> dir(10)
    ['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__class__', '__cmp__', '__coerce__', '__delattr__', 
    '__div__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__float__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', 
    '__getattribute__', '__getnewargs__', '__hash__', '__hex__', '__index__', 
    '__init__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__long__', '__lshift__', '__mod__', 
    '__mul__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__oct__', '__or__', 
    '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdiv__', '__rdivmod__', 
    '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', 
    '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', 
    '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', 
    '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__trunc__', '__xor__', 
    'bit_length', 'conjugate', 'denominator', 'imag', 'numerator', 'real']

With all those attributes and member functions, I think it's safe to say `10` is
an object.

Since everything in Python is essentially names bound to objects, we can do
silly (but interesting) stuff like this:

    #!py
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import imp
    >>> datetime.datetime.now()
    datetime.datetime(2013, 02, 14, 02, 53, 59, 608842)
    >>> class PartyTime():        
    ...     def __call__(self, *args):
    ...         imp.reload(datetime)
    ...         value = datetime.datetime(*args)
    ...         datetime.datetime = self
    ...         return value
    ...     
    ...     def __getattr__(self, value):
    ...         if value == 'now':
    ...             return lambda: print('Party Time!')
    ...         else:
    ...             imp.reload(datetime)
    ...             value = getattr(datetime.datetime, value)
    ...             datetime.datetime = self
    ...             return value
    >>> datetime.datetime = PartyTime()
    >>> datetime.datetime.now() 
    Party Time!
    >>> today = datetime.datetime(2013, 2, 14)
    >>> print(today)
    2013-02-14 00:00:00
    >>> print(today.timestamp())
    1360818000.0

`datetime.datetime` is just a name (that happens to be bound to an object 
representing the `datetime` class). We can rebind it to whatever we please. In
the example above, we bind the `datetime` attribute of the `datetime` module to
our new class, `PartyTime`. Any call to the `datetime.datetime` constructor
returns a valid `datetime` object. In fact, the class is indistinguishable from
the real `datetime.datetime` class. Except, that is, for the fact that if you call
`datetime.datetime.now()` it always prints out 'Party Time!'.

Obviously this is a silly example, but hopefully it gives you some insight into
what is possible when you fully understand and make use of Python's execution model. 
At this point, though, we've only changed bindings associated with a name. What about
changing the object itself?

###Two types of objects

It turns out Python has two flavors of objects: `mutable` and `immutable`.
The value of mutable objects can be changed after they are created. The value of
immutable objects cannot be. A `list` is a mutable object. You can create a list,
append some values, and the list is updated in place. A `string` is immutable.
Once you create a string, you can't change its value. 

I know what you're thinking: "Of course you can change the value of a string, I
do it all the time in my code!" When you "change" a string, you're actually
rebinding it to a newly created string object. The original object remains
unchanged, even though its possible that nothing refers to it anymore.

See for yourself:

    #!py
    >>> a = 'foo'
    >>> a
    'foo'
    >>> b = a
    >>> a += 'bar'
    >>> a
    'foobar'
    >>> b
    'foo'

Even though we're using `+=` and it *seems* that we're modifying the string, we
really just get a new one containing the result of the change. This is why you 
may hear people say, "string concatenation is slow.". It's because 
concatenating strings must allocate memory for a new string and copy the 
contents, while appending to a list (in most cases) requires no allocation. 
Immutable objects are fundamentally expensive to "change", because doing so 
involves creating a copy. Changing mutable objects is cheap.

###Immutable object weirdness

When I said the value of immutable objects can't change after they're created, it
wasn't the whole truth. A number of containers in Python, such as `tuple`, are 
immutable.  The value of a `tuple` can't be changed after it is created. But 
the "value" of a tuple is conceptually just a sequence of names with
unchangeable bindings to objects. The key thing to note is that 
the *bindings* are unchangeable, not the objects they are bound to.

This means the following is perfectly legal:
    
    #!py
    >>> class Foo():
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...             self.value = 0
    ...     def __str__(self):
    ...             return str(self.value)
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...             return str(self.value)
    ... 
    >>> f = Foo()
    >>> print(f)
    0
    >>> foo_tuple = (f, f)
    >>> print(foo_tuple)
    (0, 0)
    >>> foo_tuple[0] = 100
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    >>> f.value = 999
    >>> print(f)
    999
    >>> print(foo_tuple)
    (999, 999)

When we try to change an element of the tuple directly, we get a `TypeError`
telling us that (once created), `tuples` can't be assigned to. But changing the
underlying object has the effect of "changing" the value of the `tuple`.
This is a subtle point, but nonetheless important: the "value" of an immutable
object *can't* change, but it's constituent objects *can*. 

###Function calls

If variables are just `names` bound to objects, what happens when we pass them
as arguments to a function? The truth is, we aren't really passing all that much.
Take a look at this code:

    #!py
    def add_to_tree(root, value_string):
        """Given a string of characters `value_string`, create or update a
        series of dictionaries where the value at each level is a dictionary of
        the characters that have been seen following the current character.

        Example:
        >>> my_string = 'abc'
        >>> tree = {}
        >>> add_to_tree(tree, my_string)
        >>> print(tree['a']['b'])
        {'c': {}}
        >>> add_to_tree(tree, 'abd')
        >>> print(tree['a']['b'])
        {'c': {}, 'd': {}} 
        >>> print(tree['a']['d'])
        KeyError 'd'
        """

        for character in value_string:
            root = root.setdefault(character, {})

We're essentially creating an auto-vivifying dictionary that operates like a
trie. Notice that we change the `root` parameter in the `for` loop. And yet
after the function call completes, `tree` is still the same dictionary with some
updates. It is *not* the last value of `root` in the function call. So in one
sense `tree` is being updated; in another sense it's not.

To make sense of this, consider what the `root` parameter actually is: a *new* 
binding to the object refereed to by the name passed in as the `root` 
parameter. In the case of our example, `root` is a name initially bound to the 
same object as `tree`. It is *not* `tree` itself, which explains why changing 
`root` to a new dictionary in the function leaves `tree` unchanged. As you'll 
recall, assigning `root` to `root.setdefault(character, {})` merely rebinds 
`root` to the object created by the `root.setdefault(character, {})` statement.

Here's another, more straightforward, example:

    #!py
    def list_changer(input_list):
        input_list[0] = 10

        input_list = range(1, 10)
        print(input_list)
        input_list[0] = 10
        print(input_list)

    >>> test_list = [5, 5, 5]
    >>> list_changer(test_list)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    >>> print test_list
    [10, 5, 5]

Our first statement *does* change the value of the underlying list (as we can
see in the last line printed). However, once we rebind the name `input_list` by
saying `input_list = range(1, 10)`, **we're now referring to a completely
different object**. We basically said "bind the name `input_list` to this new list." 
After that line, we have no way of referring to the original `input_list` parameter 
again. 

By now, you should have a clear understanding of how binding a name works.
There's just one more item to take care of.

###Blocks and Scope

The concepts of `names`, `bindings`, and `objects` should be quite familiar at
this point. What we haven't covered, though, is how the interpreter "finds" a
name. To see what I mean, consider the following:

    #!py
    GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 42

    def print_some_weird_calculation(value):
        number_of_digits = len(str(value))

        def print_formatted_calculation(result):
            print('{value} * {constant} = {result}'.format(value=value,
                constant=GLOBAL_CONSTANT, result=result))
            print('{}   {}'.format('^' * number_of_digits, '++'))
            print('\nKey: ^ points to your number, + points to constant')

        print_formatted_calculation(value * GLOBAL_CONSTANT)
        
    >>> print_some_weird_calculation(123)
    123 * 42 = 5166
    ^^^   ++

    Key: ^ points to your number, + points to constant

This is a contrived example, but a couple of things should jump out at you.
First, how does the `print_formatted_calculation` function have access to
`value` and `number_of_digits` even though they were never passed as arguments?
Second, how do both functions seem to have access to `GLOBAL_CONSTANT`?

The answer is all about `scope`. In Python, when a name is bound to an object,
that name is only usable within the name's `scope`. The `scope` of a name is
determined by the `block` in which it was created. A `block` is just a "block"
of Python code that is executed as a single unit. The three most common types of
blocks are modules, class definitions, and the bodies of functions. So the
`scope` of a name is the innermost `block` in which it's defined.

Let's now return to the original question: how does the interpreter "find" 
what a name is bound to (or if it's even a valid name at all)? It begins 
by checking the `scope` of the innermost `block`. Then it checks the
`scope` that contained the innermost `block`, then the `scope` that contained
that, and so on. 

In the `print_formatted_calculation` function, we reference `value`. This is
resolved by first checking the `scope` of the innermost `block`, which in this
case is the body of the function itself. When it doesn't find `value` defined
there, it checks the `scope` that `print_formatted_calculation` was defined in.
In our case, that's the body of the `print_some_weird_calculation` function.
Here it does find the name `value`, and so it uses that binding and stops
looking. The same is true for `GLOBAL_CONSTANT`, it just needs to look an extra
level higher: the module (or script) level. Anything defined at this level is
considered a `global` name. These are accessible from anywhere.

A few quick things to note. A name's `scope` extends to any blocks contained 
in the block where the name was defined, *unless the name is rebound in one of
those blocks*. If `print_formatted_calculation` had the line `value = 3`, then
the `scope` of the name `value` in `print_some_weird_calculation` would only be
the body of that function. It's `scope` would not include
`print_formatted_calculation`, since that `block` rebound the name.

###Use this power wisely...

There are two keywords that can be used to tell the interpreter to
**reuse a preexisting binding**. Every other time we bind a name, it binds that name
to a new object, *but only in the current scope*. In the example above, if
we rebound `value` in `print_formatted_calculation`, it would have no affect on
the `value` in `print_some_weird_calculation`, which is
`print_formatted_calculation`'s  enclosing scope. With the
following two keywords, we can actually affect the bindings outside our local
scope.

`global my_variable` tells the interpreter to use the binding of the 
name `my_variable` in the top-most (or "global" scope).
Putting `global my_variable` in a code block 
is a way of saying, "copy the binding of this global variable, or if you don't
find it, create the name `my_variable` in the global scope." Similarly, 
the `nonlocal my_variable` statement instructs the interpreter to use the binding 
of the name `my_variable` defined in the nearest *enclosing* scope. This is a way 
to rebind a name not defined in either the local or global scope. Without `nonlocal`, we would 
only be able to alter bindings in the local scope or the global scope.
Unlike `global my_variable` however, if we use `nonlocal my_variable` then
`my_variable` must already exist; it won't be created if it's not found.

To see this in action, let's write a quick example:

    #!py

    GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 42
    print(GLOBAL_CONSTANT)
    def outer_scope_function():
        some_value = hex(0x0)
        print(some_value)

        def inner_scope_function():
            nonlocal some_value
            some_value = hex(0xDEADBEEF)

        inner_scope_function()
        print(some_value)
        global GLOBAL_CONSTANT
        GLOBAL_CONSTANT = 31337

    outer_scope_function()
    print(GLOBAL_CONSTANT)

    # Output: 
    # 42
    # 0x0
    # 0xdeadbeef
    # 31337

By making use of `global` and `nonlocal`, we're able to use and change the existing
binding of a name rather than merely assigning the name a new binding and
losing the old one.

###Summary

If you've made it to the end of this post, congratulations! Hopefully Python's
execution model is much more clear. In a (much shorter) follow-up post, I'll
show some examples of how we can make use of the fact that everything is an
object in interesting ways. Until next time...
