title: Heading to PyCon!

I'm sitting in the airport with my lovely wife (who's watching me type this) waiting to board my flight to Montreal. I'm quite excited to attend my
first PyCon, indeed my first large conference ever. If you're going to be there, let me know! Hit me up on Twitter ([@jeffknupp](http://www.twitter.com/jeffknupp)), email me at [jeff@jeffknupp.com](mailto:jeff@jeffknupp.com) or text me at (419) 455-6877. I'll be in town until Sunday afternoon, so please get in touch! Looking forward to meeting a few readers...
