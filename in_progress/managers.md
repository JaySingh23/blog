I spent more than a decade of my professional life as an individual contributor. That changed in the beginning of this
year. I had never directly managed someone in my life, but I suddenly found myself with *11* direct reports. It was
overwhelming. 

Actually, it was more than overwhelming. For the first time in my life, work was *hard*. Most of my professional
experience was intellectually stimulating, but I wouldn't describe very much of it as "hard". I almost always had a sense of
what needed to be done to solve a problem. If I didn't, I knew I could research the problem and a way forward would
almost always present itself. I spent the first eight years of my career building high-frequency trading systems in C++ for
major investment banks (Goldman Sachs and, later, Wells Fargo), so the work wasn't trivial, but it also wasn't
particularly hard.

But managing people is different. Most of the skills I had aquired during my career were worthless. If I had suddenly
become a lumberjack instead of a manager, I would have been just as prepared. I had (have) so much to learn, and my
decisions now had a direct impact on people's livelihood. I was scared that my lack of knowledge would negatively affect
my teams. "Screwing up" had taken on a whole new meaning.

And yet, despite all of the new responsibilities, fear of failure, and awareness of a lack of a severe knowledge gap,
more than anything I wanted to do one thing.

**Write code.**

## Why?

Why was (is) that the case? Why did I want to do the exact thing that I had just willingly left behind? Becoming a
manager was a choice (though the scale was a bit surprising). Had I made the wrong one? *In what other industry does management immediately yearn to do the jobs of those they manage?*

It was easy to convince myself that it was neccessary (or at the very least, acceptable) to continue writing code. Here are some common
justifications engineering managers give with regards to continuing to write code:

1. I need to keep my technical edge; I don't want to get left behind
1. My team won't respect me if they don't see how technical I am
1. I'm a very good programmer. Not writing code would be a waste of my talents
1. The team *needs me* to write code; they're not capable of solving the problem themselves

## OK, but really, WHY?

After a bit of introspection, I realized that there were two reasons I wanted so badly to write code:

1. It was familiar and safe
1. It was a large part of how I determined my self-worth

When faced with difficulty, humans naturally retreat to the familiar. I wanted to write code not because it would have
been a productive use of my time, but because every part of my new position was *unfamiliar* and *hard*. Writing code
was a safety blanket. I knew I could do it well, and while writing code I wouldn't feel so lost and frustrated.

In addition, I am a maker of things at heart. Even in the worst of times, I could usually point to something and say "I
made that." Management has no such artifacts. In fact, evaluating my performance in general was maddeningly hard. Not
only did I not know how to do the job, I didn't even know if I was doing it well. When I remove programming, which is
intimately tied to my identity, and replace it with a skill I can't even judge my performance at, bad feelings are bound
to follow.

I would come home exhausted. Days comprised almost entirely of meetings were new to me, and they took a physical toll.
As did the stress of being new and
