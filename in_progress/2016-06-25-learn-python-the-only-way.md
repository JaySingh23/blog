Everyone wants to learn Python. Demand for "learn to program" resources in general is surging across all ages. 
And yet, of those who set out to "learn Python", precious few reach the point at which they are comfortable sitting
down, opening up an editor, and banging out a quick script. Despite all of the online courses, book, blogs, and
tutorials available to the would-be Pythonista, most will give up. 

Because they don't know the secret to learning Python. The secret to learning how to program in general. 
They fail not due to lack of effort or interest, but because they are misinformed. 

**At the end of the day, there is exactly *one* way to actually learn Python.** The answer is both so simple and so
complex it boggles the mind (or, at least, boggles mine).

**The only way to learn to program in Python is to write programs in Python.** Repeatedly. Over and over again. You have
to write as much code as possible, across as many different problems domains as possible.

But, that's not all. In addition to writing code, you must get it *reviewed* as often as possible (by a more
experienced developer). After all, anyone can write ten programs poorly (and without any feedback that's likely what
you'd do). The goal is to incrementally improve with every program you write.
